# Project-3-Interactive-Form
 
Thanks for your interest in our conference! Please be sure to complete all fields in order for your registration to be entered. When selecting your T-shirt, you must first choose a size and design, then the color. 

The system will only allow you to choose 1 workshop-so don't worry! You can not mistakenly choose 2 at the same time/day. 

We prefer credit card payments, but also accept PayPal and BitCoin. 

When submitting, the system will detect any errors and ask you to fix them, such as an improperly formatted email address, or anything mentioned above. 

We look forward to meeting you at the conference! 

Sherri Holmes, Web Developer, Treehouse Tech Degree
