<h2>Project 3: Interactive Form</h2>

<h1>Welcome to Our FSJS Conference Registration page!</h1>

<p>Please enter your name, a valid email address, the workshops you plan to attend and payment information.</p>

<p>The form will not allow you to register until all fields have been completed for your registration.</p>

<p>If you enter any invalid information, the registration form will tell you exactly what you need to fix. </p>
<p>For example, if you enter less than 13 numbers for credit card payment, the form will ask you to enter the correct number. </p>
<p>The incorrect field will also highlight in red.</p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any questions about registering!</p>
